# Cellular-Automata-Simulation-System-CASS-

This repository is here not to hold the project but to inform about it. It is an under development project the witch might see light under paid licence. Is because of that that the code will not be shown.

The system developed accomplishes 3 different tasks:

  1.	Makes able the execution of bi-dimensional Cellular Automata inside Unity Engine.
  2.	Gives the user the ability to create and tests its own automata by letting him create a set of rules and also to configure a set of control mechanisms to make the simulation controllable.
  3.	Makes the system able (for now) to simulate the development over time and over a fiscal space of a population of trees. In the future it will be able to simulate other types of situations.

If you have time and want to know more about the project there is a list of videos recorded as an introduction to the system workings:
